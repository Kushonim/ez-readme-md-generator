# README Generator
## Description
This is an application that takes in the user input inside of the command line utilizing inquirer. I made this application to get a better understanding of working with npm's and to review proper readme formatting. I found this project to be quite fun and I learned that you can really do a lot with user input and I'm excited to play around with other packages.

## Installation & Demo
Simply download the files provided by the application's [repo](https://github.com/Kushonim/ez-readme-md-generator) and/or follow along with the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yKMLhENJ82I7okzAFx5-Hrx8lHN1_CDQ/view?usp=sharing). If there is no video available, open the assets folder's integrated terminal and install all npm's and run the index.js file with node.

## Usage
The application is quite simple and offers prompts for a proper README file for your project. Upon running the index file with node, inquirer's features will take place and you'll be allowed to answer the questions it asks and a README file should appear inside of the assets folder.
